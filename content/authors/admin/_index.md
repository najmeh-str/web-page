Cybersecurity is my passion. I love the challenge to solve security issues of today and future. I enjoy researching web attacks and applying data-driven approaches to understand cybercrime. Currently, my research is focused on DNS security and novel attacks on cloud platforms.
I earned my Ph.D in Computer Science from Stony Brook University working with Professor Nick Nikiforakis. I received my Masters degree from the department of Computer Engineering at Sharif University and my B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from Univeristy of Tehran.
